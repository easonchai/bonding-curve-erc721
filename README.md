### One-Of-A-Kind ERC721 & Bonding Curve
This experiment is a playground for the development of unique SPACE tokens for the [Decentramall project](https://github.com/decentramall/decentramall) 

## Features
- Fingerprinting
Each ERC721 is registered with a hashed function of the owners address, meaning only one address can hold one SPACE token.

- Bonding Curve
The EstateAgent.sol controls the price for the ERC721 token
